Churn Prediction System
This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. Built with Python and visualized using Power BI, it leverages libraries like Scikit-learn, XGBoost, pandas, and matplotlib.

How to Run
Install the required libraries:
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary libraries by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install scikit-learn xgboost pandas matplotlib
Prepare your data:
Place your customer data CSV file (customer_data.csv) in the same directory as the Python script.

Run the Python script:
Execute the script to generate churn predictions:

bash
Copy
Edit
python churn_prediction.py
Open the Power BI dashboard:
Open the churn_prediction_dashboard.pbix file in Power BI to view the churn insights and visualizations.

About
This system helps businesses predict customer churn using machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with insights visualized in Power BI.
